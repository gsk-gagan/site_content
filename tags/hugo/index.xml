      <description>Quick Summary So today I was able to launch and host my static website on GitHub and also link it to my custom domain name. The general idea is that by leveraging GitHub I won&amp;rsquo;t have to pay any web hosting services and I would also have unlimited bandwidth. This also drastically simplifies the process of having your own website as you no longer have to manage or maintain a server regularly.</description>
