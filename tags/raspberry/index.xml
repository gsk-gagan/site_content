      <description>That&amp;rsquo;s It?
The idea is to create a self balancing robot, which should learn to balance itself without explicitly coding in the logic to do so. In a traditional sense we need to apply reinforcement learning model to let the robot train itself. Instead of going into the details of how that can be accomplished, here I lay down the foundations of the hardware setup required to achieve this.
General Hardware Overview On a high level we have the following:</description>

      <title>Changing VNC Resolution (Raspberry Pi)</title>

      <description>Simple Instructions By default the VNC resolution is not apt. To change it, you can specify configuration in your Raspberry Pi, so that the VNC Viewer will start rendering in that.
To change the resolution do the following in a Terminal running on your Pi (either through ssh or VNC):
 sudo vim /boot/config.txt Then add the following below the # uncomment to force a specific HDMI mode (this will force VGA) line: hdmi_ignore_edid=0xa5000080 hdmi_group=2 hdmi_mode=85   </description>

      <title>Headless Connection to Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W</title>

      <description>Getting Started in Headless Mode In headless mode, you are using your wifi enabled Raspberry Pi (Zero 2 W, in this case) without a screen. You will need to ssh into your raspberry pi to start using it. To get started with this you have to:
 Include a blank file named &amp;ldquo;ssh&amp;rdquo; at the root of your pi&amp;rsquo;s sd card (i.e. boot drive). This tells the pi to allow ssh connection at startup.</description>
