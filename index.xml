      <description>Note to self: Don&amp;rsquo;t try to deep fake shades with old artistic paintings. You&amp;rsquo;ll end up getting dark circles.
Another note to self: Tame your beard man! You are no longer in the olden ages! :P
Overview of GAN - Generative Adversarial Network GANs as the name suggest are generative ML models used to generate artificial content. They&amp;rsquo;re popularly used to generate deep fakes, which are equivalent to real pictures. &amp;ldquo;Adversarial Networks&amp;rdquo; because under the hood they employ two deep neural networks.</description>

      <title>Changing VNC Resolution (Raspberry Pi)</title>

      <description>Simple Instructions By default the VNC resolution is not apt. To change it, you can specify configuration in your Raspberry Pi, so that the VNC Viewer will start rendering in that.
To change the resolution do the following in a Terminal running on your Pi (either through ssh or VNC):
 sudo vim /boot/config.txt Then add the following below the # uncomment to force a specific HDMI mode (this will force VGA) line: hdmi_ignore_edid=0xa5000080 hdmi_group=2 hdmi_mode=85   </description>

      <title>Headless Connection to Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W</title>

      <description>Getting Started in Headless Mode In headless mode, you are using your wifi enabled Raspberry Pi (Zero 2 W, in this case) without a screen. You will need to ssh into your raspberry pi to start using it. To get started with this you have to:
 Include a blank file named &amp;ldquo;ssh&amp;rdquo; at the root of your pi&amp;rsquo;s sd card (i.e. boot drive). This tells the pi to allow ssh connection at startup.</description>

      <title>Creating a Static Website and Hoisting it on GitHub</title>
      <link>/post/20220202/</link>

      <description>Quick Summary So today I was able to launch and host my static website on GitHub and also link it to my custom domain name. The general idea is that by leveraging GitHub I won&amp;rsquo;t have to pay for any web hosting services and also have unlimited bandwidth. This also drastically simplifies having your own website as you no longer have to manage or maintain a server regularly.
The only downside or restriction is that only static websites can be hosted on GitHub.</description>

      <description>The idea of this site is to keep posting all the things that I do with minimal efforts. I believe I am simply going to keep a log of all the things I do an a regular basis.
I think there&amp;rsquo;ll be a retrospective section as well. But for current phase I will simply reference all my projects since Jan 2022.
