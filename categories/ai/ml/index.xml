      <description>That&amp;rsquo;s It?
The idea is to create a self balancing robot, which should learn to balance itself without explicitly coding in the logic to do so. In a traditional sense we need to apply reinforcement learning model to let the robot train itself. Instead of going into the details of how that can be accomplished, here I lay down the foundations of the hardware setup required to achieve this.
General Hardware Overview On a high level we have the following:</description>

      <description>Long lost twin!
Overview of GAN - Generative Adversarial Network GANs as the name suggest are generative ML models used to generate artificial content. They&amp;rsquo;re popularly used to generate deep fakes, which are equivalent to real pictures. &amp;ldquo;Adversarial Networks&amp;rdquo; because under the hood they employ two deep neural networks. One network is used to generate deep fakes and the other network (the adversary) is responsible for detecting deep fakes from real images.</description>
