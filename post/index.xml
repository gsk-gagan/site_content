      <description>The idea of this site is to keep posting all the things that I do with minimal efforts. I believe I am simply going to keep a log of all the things I do an a regular basis.
I think there&amp;rsquo;ll be a retrospective section as well. But for current phase I will simply reference all my projects since Jan 2022.

      <title>Headless Connection to Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W</title>

      <description>Getting Started in Headless Mode In headless mode, you are using your wifi enabled Raspberry Pi (Zero 2 W, in this case) without a screen. You will need to ssh into your raspberry pi to start using it. To get started with this you have to:
 Include a blank file named &amp;ldquo;ssh&amp;rdquo; at the root of your pi&amp;rsquo;s sd card (i.e. boot drive). This tells the pi to allow ssh connection at startup.</description>

      <title>Creating a Static Website and Hoisting it on GitHub</title>

      <description>Quick Summary So today I was able to launch and host my static website on GitHub and also link it to my custom domain name. The general idea is that by leveraging GitHub I won&amp;rsquo;t have to pay for any web hosting services and also have unlimited bandwidth. This also drastically simplifies having your own website as you no longer have to manage or maintain a server regularly.
The only downside or restriction is that only static websites can be hosted on GitHub.</description>
